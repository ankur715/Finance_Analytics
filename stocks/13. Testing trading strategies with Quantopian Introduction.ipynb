    "What Quantopian does is it adds a GUI layer on top of the Zipline back testing library for Python, along with a bunch of data sources as well, many of which are completely free to work with. You can also get capital allocations from Quantopian by licensing your strategy to them if you meet certain criteria. Generally, a beta between -0.3 and +0.3 is a good starting point, but you also need to have other healthy metrics to compete. More on this later, let's learn about the basics of Quantopian first. Since Quantopian is powered by primarily open sourced libraries like Zipline, Alphalens, and Pyfolio, you can also run a Quantopian-like platform locally if you like. I find most people who are interested in running locally are interested in this to keep their algorithms private. Quantopian does not view your algorithms unless you give them permission to, and the community only sees your algorithms if you share them. I highly encourage you to view your relationship with Quantopian not as an adversarial one, but instead as a partnership. If you come up with something of high quality, Quantopian is very interested in working with, and has the funding to invest in, you. In this relationship, Quantopian is bringing the platform, funding, and other experts in the field to help you, it's a pretty good deal in my opinion."

If you actually begin to type out sid(, Quantopian has a nice auto completion functionality where you can begin to either type the company's name or ticker symbol to find their sid. The reason for using sid is because company tickers can change over periods of time. This is one way to ensure that you're getting the ticker you're actually intending to get. You can also use symbol() to use the ticker, and make your code a bit more easy to read, but this is not recommended, since the ticker can change.\n",
